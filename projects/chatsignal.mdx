ChatSignal is web application, leveraging the power of WebRTC for establishing peer to peer video call and React as front-end library. It also uses Node.js on the server, for the signaling tasks (exchange of session descriptions, etc).
In short, it's a video call app.

## Why?

Well, at that time, we were in the middle of the COVID-19 pandemic. Due to restrictions assigned to people (poeple were not allowed to go out, etc), real-time apps such as Zoom had a big boom and increased in popularity. These apps allowed them to stay in touch with friends, family and work.
So, I wondered how these apps work and how they were built and there came the idea of this project.

## Tools & Stack

React, Typescript, ESLint, Vite.js, Node.js, Express.js, WebRTC

## Improvements

- **File sharing** with the help of `RTCDatachannel` to enact the communicants to send  and receive files between them.

- **Level up into a full-fledged video conferencing app**: actually a video call session in ChatSignal support only two participants. We can increase that amount, but I strongly suggest to use some third party library or services such as Twilio or Agora instead of dorectly playing with the WebRTC APIs to do so.

## Final words

It was pretty exhausting, to sync React with the WebRTC APIs, in particular:

* figuring out that the `RTCPeerConnection` object should be set as a Ref to persist between component re-renders.

* sending and receiving the `RTCSessionDescription` objects between the communicants, and finding a way to harmonize it with the React way.

Nevertheless it was a fun and very instructive project. Feel free to fork, explore and bring remarks to he projects. Happy hacking ðŸ˜‰.
