Utimer is yet another rather simple timer android app which I built with the help of React native.

## Why?

At the time, I was wondering how to make Android apps and busted my head against the android developers website. What I can say is that android development with the native langages (i.e. Java and Kotlin) is very intimidating ant not friendly at all for beginners.

Then I have started to get interested in alternative frameworks such React Native to do the work. I already heard of React Native before, A Javascript Framework that lets you build Android apps by leveraging React's paradigm. The choice was evident since I already had a knowledge of React and Javascript at that time. And I can say that I've been impressed by how easy it is to get started with React Native and how easy it is to make changes on your app thanks to React's JSX compared to native android development and the ugly XML.

## Demo

## The process

Utimer is a simple app, all it's logic is inside the a single component: [Main.js](https://github.com/radandevist/utimer/blob/master/src/pages/main/Main.js), and it doesn't use any native API inside it. All I've done is just to do some number calculations and use Javascript's timer funcions: `setInterval` and `clearInterval` to update some states which would be used for the counter's screening.

The main challenge was rather how build and animate the counter's progerss ring, as you can see in the previous gif demonstration, with the counter's state value.

To do so, I used to draw an SVG circle's stroke and managed to link the style property `strokeDashOffset` of that SVG with the remaining seconds of the counter count. You can see what I'm talkin about in the `<ProgressRing />` component [here](https://github.com/radandevist/utimer/blob/master/src/components/ProgressRing.js).

## Improvements

A lot of features could be added to this app, such as, to mention a few:

- persistence of the counter state  and ability to run on the background, because sometimes, the user needs to check other apps and don't want to lose the actual timer count.

- Notification on timer count completion, to get the user up to date with his count.

## Finally

I don't see anything more to say than It was a fun project and feel free to inspect the code and bring your remarks if you want to. ðŸ˜‰
