excerpt: Combining the Next.js Image component with a Blog that uses mdx. How did I do to harmonize them?

Following one of my previous post about lazy loading Next.js images inside mdx generated blog posts ([read that post](/blog/how-to-make-a-blurred-placeholder-for-next-js-image-with-cloudinary)), one another issue emerged: the images were not occupying the full-width of the container. 

Although the Next.js Image component has built-in lazy loading, you are still required to specify a width and height. However, this knowledge is typically unknown to you upfront. You also don't want photos that have been given the incorrect width or height to seem chopped.

I learned that you can get around this with a few lines of CSS. Your photos will therefore take up the entire area in the div.

As a result, wrap the Image component in a div with `img-contain` and give it (the Image component) the className `custom-img`. Note that `fill` must be selected as the layout mode.

```jsx:ImageBlog.jsx
<div className="img-contain">
  <Image
    className="custom-img"
    alt="Mountains"
    src="/project/pexels-photo.jpeg"
    layout="fill"
  />
</div>
```

Here is the CSS styles that overrides the capabilities of next.js.

```css:imgage-blog.css
.custom-img {
  object-fit: contain;
  width: 100% !important;
  position: relative !important;
  height: unset !important;
}

.img-contain {
  width: 100%;
}
.img-contain > div {
  position: unset !important;
}
```

I came across that solution, afters sweat and tears, thanks to the to the following [github discussion](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/discussions/18739#discussioncomment-344932) ðŸ¤£.
