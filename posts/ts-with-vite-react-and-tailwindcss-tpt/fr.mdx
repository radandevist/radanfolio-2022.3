Getting started with an new project is exciting, but at some point, we use to get tired by the routine it comes with to set up a new project. The idea behind a boilerplate is to provide a starter template to start with the  configurations which satifyies us the most on the average. And in this post, I'll show you how I made mine for my React and Typescript project.

I have to mention that, the resulting setup from this post, will serve of base template for every upcoming projects which will be published on my blog. Every time we'll start a React project, i'll provide a link back tho this post to help everyone to bear with me.

## Create a React App with Vite

Every React developer should be accommodated with *create-react-app* which help us bootstrap a React app quickly. However, I opted for an alternative: [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) to do that. Vite is way much times faster than *create-react-app*, making the development experience better.

> Vite (French word for "quick", pronounced `/vit/`, like "veet") is a build tool that aims to provide a faster and leaner development experience for modern web projects.

```bash:terminal
yarn create vite react-boilerplate --template react-ts
```

With the above command, we are telling vite to create a new app under the `react-boileplate`  folder with the React and Typescript template.

## Install and configure ESLint

To enforce good practices while writing code, ESLint is the tool to go. Thus we have to install it as a devdepency in our project like so:

```bash:terminal
cd react-boilerplate
yarn add -D eslint
```

Once Installed, we need to configure eslint.

```bash:terminal
yarn eslint --init
```

From there, the prompt will ask you some questions and you will have to choose among the available options as the same as on the following gif:

![eslint config prompt](https://res.cloudinary.com/dhwkzyl32/image/upload/q_65/v1660289368/radanfolio/posts/setup-a-react-and-typescript-project-boilerplate-with-vite-tailwindcss-and-eslint/eslint5_l8a5o6.gif)

To get along with the above gif, here are some short explanations on what does these questions prompts means:

1. We want ESLint to not only check syntax and find problemsbut also to enforce us with some standard or style  in our code. Formatting code could be done with *Prettier* but I prefer ESLint for that task.
2. Since we are setting up a Typescript project, the ES modules option is the correct option here: Typescript uses ES6 import export syntax by default.
3. Obviously, we are using React.
4. And so, we are using Typescript
5. Speaking of a react project which is a front-end framework, it's obvious that we want it to run in the browser
6. We're gonna use some pre-defined set of rules for formatting or styling our code: airbnb's style guide is one of the most popular out there.
7. Use the JSON file format to store our ESLint configuration
8. Finally, rather than installing all required dependency right now, let just install them manually later to get the very latest version of each of them.

### Installing the Eslint config packages

Well in the last question prompt previously, we've been asked for if we wanted to install the necessary dependency in order to make our ESLint config work. I didn't do so because it will install older versions of these packages so instead we do it manually to get the latest ones.

```bash:terminal
yarn add -D eslint-config-airbnb eslint-plugin-react @typescript-eslint/parser @typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y eslint-plugin-import
```

### Test your eslint configuration

```bash:terminal
yarn eslint 'src/**/*.{ts,tsx}' # lint ts/tsx files in the src directory
```

Any mis-typing in our code will be reported in our terminal. Or, If you're using VS Code and have the eslint plugin installed in it, they (the syntax errors, etc) will be underlined in red for errors and yellow for warnings (howevwer ). And to fix them just append the `--fix` option to the previous command and here we go. Or, once again, if you're using VS code (and have the eslint plugin installed in it), search for **Fix auto fixable problems** from the command palette (<kbd>Ctrl + Shift + P</kbd>).

![eslint linting](https://res.cloudinary.com/dhwkzyl32/image/upload/q_65/v1660289442/radanfolio/posts/setup-a-react-and-typescript-project-boilerplate-with-vite-tailwindcss-and-eslint/eslint4_ukhbsi.gif)

You can even define a run-script for linting your code in package.json:

```json:package.json
...
"scripts": {
  ...
  "lint": "eslint 'src/**/*.{ts,tsx}'"
},
```

### Eslint rules configuration

Basically, the default eslint configuration provided by the **airbnb stytle guide** are just enough to get started. But I do have some preferences so I needed to add my own rules to the config file as well. At the end this is how my `.eslintrc.json` looks like:

```json:.eslintrc.json
{
    "env": {
        "browser": true,
        "es2021": true
    },
    "extends": [
        "plugin:react/recommended",
        "airbnb"
    ],
    "parser": "@typescript-eslint/parser",
    "parserOptions": {
        "ecmaFeatures": {
            "jsx": true
        },
        "ecmaVersion": "latest",
        "sourceType": "module"
    },
    "plugins": [
        "react",
        "@typescript-eslint"
    ],
    "rules": {
      "react/jsx-filename-extension": [2, { "extensions": [".js", ".jsx", ".ts", ".tsx"] }],
      "no-use-before-define": "off",
      "@typescript-eslint/no-use-before-define": ["error"],
      "import/extensions": [
        "error",
        "ignorePackages",
        {
          "js": "never",
          "jsx": "never",
          "ts": "never",
          "tsx": "never"
        }
      ],
      "quotes": ["error", "double"],
      "import/order": ["error", {
        "groups": ["builtin", "external", "internal", "parent", "sibling", "index", "object", "type"],
        "newlines-between": "always"
      }],
      "operator-linebreak": ["error", "before", {
        "overrides": { "=": "after" }
      }]
    },
    "settings": {
        "import/resolver": {
            "node": {
                "extensions": [".js", ".jsx", ".ts", ".tsx"]
            }
        }
    }
}
```

## Tailwind CSS

Knowing that we are using a Vite which is a build tool, we need to install tailwind as a *postcss* plugin as mentioned in [tailwinds docs](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation/using-postcss).

Install the required packages and initialize tailwindcss at first:

```bash:trrminal
yarn add -D tailwindcss postcss autoprefixer
yarn tailwindcss init # will create a tailwind.config.js file
```

Now, create a *postcss* config file: `postcss.config.js` at the root directory of our project and fill it with the following configuration:

```javascript:postcss.config.js
module.exports = {
  plugins: {
    tailwindcss: {},
    autoprefixer: {},
  },
}
```

In `tailwind.config.js` configure your template paths. These are the paths tailwindcss will look for at build time so it can decide on which css classes to purge or not.

```javascript:tailwind.config.js
module.exports = {
  content: [ // purge all tailwind css classes which aren't used in these files paths
  "index.html", // ++
  "./src/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}" // ++
  ],
  theme: {
    extend: {},
  },
  plugins: [],
}
```

Then, import tailwindcss css file in our app's entry point file i.e. in `src/main.tsx`

```javascript:main.tsx
import React from 'react'
// more imports ? ...
import "tailwindcss/tailwind.css"; // ++

ReactDOM.render(
  // ...
)
```

Once these steps complete, we can use tailwind's utility classes for styling in our project. For example, `App.tsx` with tailwindcss looks like this:

```typescript:App.tsx
import React, { useState } from "react";

import logo from "./logo.svg";

function App() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  return (
    <div className="text-center">
      <header className="bg-neutral-900 min-h-screen flex flex-col items-center justify-center text-xl text-white">
        <img src={logo} className="App-logo h-16 pointer-events-none animate-spin" alt="logo" />
        <p>Hello Vite + React!</p>
        <p>
          <button
            type="button"
            onClick={() => setCount((c) => c + 1)}
            className="text-xl bg-blue-500 hover:bg-blue-400 text-white font-bold py-2 px-4 border-b-4 border-blue-700 hover:border-blue-500 rounded"
          >
            count is:
            {" "}
            {count}
          </button>
        </p>
        <p>
          Edit
          {" "}
          <code>App.tsx</code>
          {" "}
          and save to test HMR updates.
        </p>
        <p>
          <a
            className="text-cyan-400"
            href="https://reactjs.org"
            target="_blank"
            rel="noopener noreferrer"
          >
            Learn React
          </a>
          {" | "}
          <a
            className="App-link"
            href="https://vitejs.dev/guide/features.html"
            target="_blank"
            rel="noopener noreferrer"
          >
            Vite Docs
          </a>
        </p>
      </header>
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

## Final words

Our react project setup is finally ready to use!! And during development time, you can realize that refreshing is as fast as light. From the version 3 of Tailwind CSS has a JIT (Just In Time) compiler which make updating utility classes even faster than before.

So, we have covered how to setup a new react and typescipt project. Future posts featuring any new react project will start from the template we've made in this post. From now on, this is our standard react boilerplate.

Next, we're gonna setup a template for backend server with node.js and typescript.
