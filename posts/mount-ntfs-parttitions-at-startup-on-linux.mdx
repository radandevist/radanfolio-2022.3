excerpt: The beauty of Linux is that you have full control over your structure and mounting partitions does not make exception to that rule.

I have both linux and windows (dual boot) on my machine so the disk is partitioned in three:
- the Linux OS,
- Windows 10, and
- a partition for sharing files between the two OS (because we can't browse linux file system from windows).

Each time I boot up onto Linux and i want to explore my other partitions, I have to mount them first. But actually, we can make them mount automatically at startup.

open the file `/etc/fstab` with your prefered editor:

```bash:terminal
sudo nano /etc/fstab
```

you will see something like this (it may slightly vary acccording to the distro):

```bash:/etc/fstab
# /etc/fstab: static file system information.
#
# Use 'blkid' to print the universally unique identifier for a device; this may
# be used with UUID= as a more robust way to name devices that works even if
# disks are added and removed. See fstab(5).
#
# <file system> <mount point>   <type>  <options>       <dump>  <pass>                 
UUID=b57600bf-231d-4da2-bd44-e392eag85627 /              ext4    defaults,noatime 0 1
```

As you can see you will need the UUID of the partition you wanna auto-mount. To get it just run in a terminal:

```bash:terminal
sudo blkid
```

A list of your machine's devices will show up with some of their informations including their UUID's. Select your desired UUID and return back to `/etc/fstab` file.

at the end of the file amend the line:

```bash:/etc/fstab
UUID=YOUR_UUID /path/to/mount/point  auto,nofail,uid=1000,gid=1000,utf8,umask=022,defaults 0 0
```

Don't forget to replace uuid, path to mount point and the partittion file system.

### Information about ntfs partition file system:

Personnally I wanted to mount a partition that can be explored from windows i.e. an <span class="text-brand1">ntfs</span> partition. On linux the corresponding key for mounting that type of file system is `ntfs-3g`. Youll' need the eponym package installed on your Linux OS. It's already preinstalled on almost all Linux distributions but check it however in case you removed it unintentionally. I strugled a little bit finding that out the first time I used Arch so I think it may help someone to mention it.

I will not cover the mount options in this post but you can learn more about them [here](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/fstab).
