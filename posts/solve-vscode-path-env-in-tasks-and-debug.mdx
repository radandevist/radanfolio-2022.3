excerpt: A weird behaviour occured to me in VSCode, here is how I dealt with it.

This issue occurs when we use zsh and we want to launch tasks or debugging sessions in VS Code. It typically throws the following error:

```bash:terminal
The terminal process \"/usr/bin/zsh '-c', 'yarn run start'\" failed to launch (exit code: 127)
```

The problem is that no commands are recognized because `~/.zshrc` was not sourced while launching VS Code and the `PATH` environment variable is not set at all.

But notice that within the integrated terminal, `PATH` is correct.

Plus, if we launch VS Code from a terminal instead of from the application menu, we don't encouner that error.

What we need to do is to adjust the desktop entry file `/usr/share/applications/code.desktop` or `~/.local/share/applications/code.desktop` `Exec` field like below:

```bash:bash
Exec=zsh -c "source $HOME/.zshrc && code"
```

This is how my `code.desktop` file look like after editing:

And so, our pain is goneðŸ¤—.
